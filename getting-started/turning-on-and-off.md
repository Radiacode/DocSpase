The swing buttons are automatically locked after 5, 10, 15, 30 seconds of inactivity. At the same time, the backlight of the screen is switched off, if it was on. In addition, there are 2 additional time intervals for the display backlighting - 2 and 5 minutes, the swing buttons are locked after 30 seconds of inactivity.

The time until the backlight auto-locks and turns off depends on the #[settings](../settings/).
