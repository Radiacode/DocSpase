The swing buttons are automatically locked after 5, 10, 15, 30 seconds of inactivity. At the same time, the backlight of the screen is switched off, if it was on. In addition, there are 2 additional time intervals for the display backlighting - 2 and 5 minutes, the swing buttons are locked after 30 seconds of inactivity.

The time until the backlight auto-locks and turns off depends on the #settings.

You can unlock these buttons by long pressing the round button \[1]. This will also turn on the screen backlight, if it is enabled in the instrument settings.

If there is sufficient light in the "Auto" mode, the backlight will not be switched on. The buttons can be switched back to the locked state by briefly pressing the round button \[1].

A short press on the up/down swing buttons \[2, 3] is used to:

* move between menu items;
* setting numerical values.
* additional options in different modes.

Long press on the up/down swing buttons\[2, 3] is used for different purposes in different cases. In menus, a long press on the up/down swing buttons\[2, 3] leads to a quick selection of items. In scene display modes, a long press on the "up" swing button turns the sound indication on and off.

Which of the swing buttons will be "up" and which will be "down" depends on the screen orientation settings.

When moving through the menu at any level, the selected item will be presented in negative - light on dark.

Detailed description of using the buttons in different modes can be found in the sections "Display Modes" Ð¸ "Menu Usage".

Pressing any button is accompanied by a short sound and vibration, depending on the settings.

\*The sound and vibration accompanying button presses can be turned off.

At all levels, the menu is arranged in a cyclical fashion. For example, on the main level, pressing the down swing button moves the focus from item to item in the following order:  !\[\[dose\_rate\_sym.png]] !\[\[a1-17-40x40-48.png]] !\[\[dose\_sym.png]]!\[\[a1-17-40x40-48.png]] !\[\[lookup\_sym.png]]  !\[\[a1-17-40x40-48.png]] !\[\[onoff\_sym.png]] !\[\[a1-17-40x40-48.png]] !\[\[info\_sym.png]]  !\[\[a1-17-40x40-48.png]] !\[\[setting\_sym.png]] !\[\[a1-17-40x40-48.png]]   !\[\[spectrum\_sym.png]] !\[\[a1-17-40x40-48.png]] !\[\[dose\_rate\_sym.png]]

Use a short press on the up/down swing buttons to select the desired item. The selected item will be highlighted with a negative icon. To confirm the selection, use a short press on the round button.

Only three selections are available on the instrument screen at a time, the others will become available when the up/down swing buttons are pressed again.
