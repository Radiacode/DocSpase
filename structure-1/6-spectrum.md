# 6 Spectrum

This window displays the energy spectrum of the photon (gamma and X-ray) radiation, typed by the device over a certain period of time. When you connect the device to the smartphone, the app reads the spectrum data from the device. Subsequently, the spectrum graph is updated either automatically at the interval specified in the settings, or manually.

At the top right of the graph you can see:

* Â·  the time for which the spectrum data was accumulated, in the format HH:MM:SS.
