Portable dosimeter portable radiation detector  Radiacode-10X series is designed to assess the radiation situation in real time. In addition, the instrument automatically keeps a log of measurement results and events. This makes it possible to analyze them, including with the help of standard software on a smartphone or personal computer. The dosimeter is suitable for work on the ground, with samples of construction materials, with specially selected and prepared food or soil samples.

Results at any moment can be presented in the form of dose rate estimation, count rate, accumulated dose, absorbed radiation energy spectrum. Assessment and accumulation of data do not depend on the change of display mode. The instrument allows storing the accumulated data in the internal memory up to thousand last hours of observations.
