| In all display modes except settings, the display shows a logarithmic indicator: |   |                |                                                                     |

Each horizontal bar shows a graphical representation of a value (dose rate, dose, count rate) on a logarithmic scale. The ranges of the bars differ by a factor of 10. For example, for dose rate (ÂµSv/h) the ranges will look as follows: !\[\[indicator\_levels\_sym.png]]

Various icons are used to label fields on the instrument status panel.
