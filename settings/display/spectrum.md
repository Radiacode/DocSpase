# Spectrum

#### Spectrum

The mode is intended for representation of the general view of the photon (gamma and X-ray) radiation energy spectrum.

In the **Spectrum** display mode the screen shows: state panel - from top; energy spectrum of photon (gamma and X-ray) radiation.

The upper part of the screen, from left to right, contains basic information about the instrument status:

<div data-full-width="true">

</div>

* scale of the amplitude scale of the photon radiation energy spectrum - linear or logarithmic;
* time since the beginning of spectrum accumulation: hours, minutes, seconds;
* sign of exceeding thresholds by dose rate, dose rate, count rate;
* audio indication status;
* Bluetooth or USB connection;
* swing buttons lock sign;
* \[battery]\(Before use) status.

At the bottom of the screen from left to right:

&#x20;![](<../../.gitbook/assets/presentation\_spectrum\_log\_1MeV\_scale\_Cs137\_f 1.png>)

* graphical representation of dose rate estimation.
* histogram of the photon radiation energy spectrum;

Labels are placed under the energy scale of the histogram:

* dots - every 100keV;
* dashes every 500keV;
* arrows - every 1000keV.

{% hint style="info" %}
Quick control of the spectrum view is available via the buttons:

* a short press on the upper swing button switches the spectrum amplitude scale between linear and logarithmic;
* a short press on the lower button of the swing cycles the scale of the energy scale 1MeV -> 2MeV -> 3MeV -> 1MeV.... ;
* long press on the lower button of the swing clears the screen and starts a new session of spectrum accumulation;
* long pressing the upper button of the swing turns on and off the sound indication.
{% endhint %}

Each horizontal bar shows a graphical representation of a value (dose rate, dose, count rate) on a logarithmic scale.

The ranges of the bars differ by a factor of 10. For example, for dose rate (ÂµSv/h) the ranges will look as follows:
