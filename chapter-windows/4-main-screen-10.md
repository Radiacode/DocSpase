| <p>If the device firmware requires an update, the firmware version number will be displayed in yellow. The device firmware is included in the application itself, so the application knows both the device firmware version and the firmware version for which the application is designed.<br><br>It is possible that the device has a newer firmware version than the one for which the application is designed. This happens when the device firmware has already been updated via RadiaCode for Windows and the app hasn't been updated yet. In this case, the firmware number is displayed in red and the application should be updated to GooglePlay, otherwise the correct operation of the application with the device is not guaranteed.<br><br>The main menu item “About RadiaCode” gives information about the version of the application and firmware, as well as their correspondence to one another.</p> |
| <p>Current status of the device and application: location, status and strength of the Bluetooth signal, temperature of the device.<br>If the location icon is gray, then the application does not write the current location to the database, either because this option is disabled in the application settings, or because it is impossible to determine the location.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| This button at the top of the screen becomes visible and blinks when the alarm threshold is exceeded, if the device sounds are enabled. Tapping this button mutes the alarm until either an alarm of a higher level occurs, or the alarm ends and reappears. The same is done by pressing the round button on the device body.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| <p>Pulse count rate graph. The start and end date/time of the data section loaded into application memory from the database is displayed in blue at the top of the graph. This portion of the data is available for display in the graphs.<br><br>At the top right, the current value of the count rate is displayed - the number of emission pulses recorded by the device's sensor in one second or one minute, depending on the selected settings.<br><br>The time scale is displayed above the X-axis, on the graph it is 4 minutes. That is, the graph displays data for 4 minutes. The scale can be changed using the “+” and “-” buttons next to the graph, as well as the pinch gesture. For more details see Graph displaying.<br><br>The X-axis displays the calendar time corresponding to the beginning and end of the graph. If the time corresponds to the current day (“today”), then the date is not displayed, otherwise the date will be displayed above the time.<br><br>If the graph displays the most recent data that correspond to real time, then on the right, in a lighter color, live data are displayed that have been read by the device from its sensor, but have not yet been processed (data processing and filtering algorithms require a certain amount of accumulated data for processing). Already processed and filtered values ?are displayed in green on the graph.<br><br>In Graph settings, you can specify whether the application should always connect points on the graph with a line. You can set the time interval so that the points on the graph that are separated by a value greater than the interval will not be connected by a line, but will be displayed with gaps.</p> |

· Show the selected portion in the log. Note that the log may not display the entry corresponding to

the tap point due to the filters specified in the log settings.\

4.1 Graph displaying\
The count rate and dose rate graphs display data and are operated in the same way.

If the graph displays the most recent data corresponding to real time, then on the right, in gray, operational data is displayed that was read by the device from its sensor, but was not yet processed (data processing and filtering algorithms need to accumulate a certain amount of data). Already processed and filtered values ?are displayed on the graphs in green/blue. Live data is stored for the last 10 minutes.

One can control the live data filter that is displayed on the graph. You can set the width of the filtering window in the graph settings, i.e. the time over which the data is averaged. Such averaging is performed by the device, serves only to display operational data and is not related to data processing

by the device, as a result of which the values displayed by color graphs are calculated.

On the dose rate graph, vertical colored lines with a circle at the top show the moments when alarms occurred. These lines can be disabled in the graph settings.

Scale selection

The displayed data can be displayed in linear, logarithmic and quadratic scales. The current scale name is displayed at the top left of the graph; it is the square root in the example.

The scale can be changed either explicitly in graph settings,, which are called by the button , or by double-tapping the graph. You can set your own scale for each graph.

Y-axis zooming

By default, the displayed plot area fills the entire area visible in the window along the Y axis. The horizontal grid always has 8 cells, and the digitization values a?re calculated dynamically based on the displayed data. It should be borne in mind that two additional points are involved in determining the maximum and minimum values ?o?f the visible area: one beyond the left border of the area and one beyond the right.

You can select automatic scaling along the Y-axis both in the current visible area and in the entire range of data available to the application in the graph settings. Each graph (count rate, dose rate) has its own setting.

Graphs can be moved along the Y-axis (up/down) by swiping your finger across the screen. Initially, to switch from automatic scaling to manual scaling, you need to move the graph up or down vigorously enough (protection against accidental shift during paging). In this case, automatic scaling is disabled, and the graph can be precisely positioned with gestures in order, for example, to find out the values i?n peaks.

With the pinch gesture on the screen, you can stretch and shrink graphs both vertically and horizontally. When pinching vertically, the auto zoom mode is also disabled.

The “A” button is both an indicator of the current zoom mode and a means of returning to the last auto zoom mode selected. The icon on the button corresponds to the selected mode:

In graph settings, you can disable the transition to the manual scaling mode. In this case, attempts to shift the graphs and pinch along the Y axis are ignored, and the “A” button is highlighted in red.

X-axis zooming

Scaling of graphs along the X axis (time axis) is performed either by using the buttons and , or a pinch gesture. A long tap of the button increases the zoom to the maximum or decreases to the minimum.

Scrolling graphs horizontally is performed by usual gestures, as well as buttons and . The buttons search for the previous/next piece of data after a break in time.\
A long tap of the button moves to the very beginning or, respectively, to the very end of the graph. The data is displayed in certain portions. When the limit is reached, a new piece of data is loaded from the database.
