The radiation hardness graph makes it possible at any time to estimate which energies predominate in the gamma-ray spectrum (low, medium, high). The application has a built-in table of hardness coefficients of reference values from ionizing radiation sources. Thanks to this table, it is possible to tell which isotope best corresponds to a particular hardness value.

The determination of isotopes is conditional. If, for example, the application has determined that the radiation hardness corresponds to the reference radiation hardness from, for example, caesium-137, then this only gives reason to assume that the radiation hardness is the same as that of the reference source of caesium-137.

Also, pseudo-determination of isotopes will not work if there are several radionuclides in the sample or gamma field.

In the graph settings, you can choose which isotopes from the table will participate in the pseudo- determination, and which will not. This allows you to disable the display of rare isotopes to reduce the likelihood of incorrect determination.
```

3\. 4.3  Graph settings\
Graph settings are accessed with the button . The count rate and dose rate graphs have the

```
same settings, individual for each graph.  
Show charts: In the drop-down list, you can choose which charts to display.

The width of the window for averaging operational data, when displayed on graphs: time, over which the device averages operational data (operational data is displayed on the graphs in gray). Such averaging is performed by the device, serves only to display operational data and is not related to data processing by the device, as a result of which the values displayed by color graphs are calculated. An increase in the averaging time leads to a smoother, but less rapid reaction to changes in the radiation situation.

Y-Axis Scale: selection between linear, logarithmic and square root scales. You can also switch the scale by double-tapping the corresponding graph.

Y-axis zoom mode:

· Across the entire range: minimum and maximum values of the Y-axis data is calculated over the entire range of data available to the application. In this mode, the digitization of the Y axis does not change, when scrolling the graph horizontally.

· By visible area: minimum and maximum values of the Y-axis data is calculated from the plot of data shown on the graph. When scrolling through the graph, as well as when new data from the device is received, these values ?will change.

· Disabled: autoscale mode disabled. For autoscaling see Graph displaying.\
Display alarm events 1/2: One can turn off the display of vertical colored lines on the dose rate

graph, which correspond to the moments when alarms occur.

Average value graphs: These graphs display the values of quantities averaged over several neighboring counts. Average value graphs are useful when the measured values are small and the random error is significant, for example, with a natural radiation background. For each reference, the averaging is performed by calculating the arithmetic mean values to the right and left of this reference. For example, if the width of the averaging window is set to 7 counts, then averaging is performed by summing the value of the current count, three counts to the left of it, three to the right, and dividing the resulting sum by 7.

If the time gap between adjacent counts exceeds 5 minutes, then averaging is not performed. It is also not performed for samples that are at the very beginning and at the very end of the buffer, because there is not enough data to average.

The "Graph line thickness" option in this case selects the thickness of the graph lines of the average values relative to the line thickness of the main graphs. The other options of the group control the appearance of the main graphs.

Graph settings:\
Graph line thickness: you can choose the thickness of the graph lines, in conventional units.

Values f?ont size: you can select the size of the digits for the count rate and dose rate, in conventional units.

Indicator bar history: You can select the time interval for which the blue zone will be displayed in the dose rate/count rate indicator. The blue zone shows the boundaries where the rate value was in the given time interval. If you select "Last .... minutes" option, the blue zone boundaries are updated every minute. If the real-time dose rate/count rate value coming from the device exceeds the current limits, the limits are updated according to the current value.

The indicator bar shows: Select which value the indicator displays - dose rate or count rate.

Labels on graphs: You can choose where the values of the measured values, together with the units of measurement and the error, will be located on the graphs - on the right or on the left. If you disable the "Show titles" option, the application will not display the names of the measured values ("Dose rate", "Count rate"...).

Buttons and indicator bar: you can choose between two layouts of the page with graphs: on one layout the control buttons and the graphical dose rate/count rate indicator are on the right side of the graphs, on the other one - on top, which gives the graphs more horizontal space. This option works only for the portrait orientation of the screen, with the horizontal orientation the buttons are always displayed on the right side.

"Search" mode settings are accessed with the button . The count rate and dose rate graphs have

the same settings, individual for each graph.\
Show charts: In the drop-down list, you can choose which charts to display.

Averaging window width: the time for which the averaging of operational data takes place. Averaging is necessary to reduce the range of fluctuations of the arrows and the boundaries of the statistical zones on the indicators. Averaging is performed by calculating the arithmetic mean for the specified time interval. If you specify an interval equal to zero, then averaging will not be performed.

The graphs display the operational data "as is", without averaging.

Average value graphs: These graphs display the values of quantities averaged over several neighboring counts. Average value graphs are useful when the measured values are small and the random error is significant, for example, with a natural radiation background. For each reference, the averaging is performed by calculating the arithmetic mean values to the right and left of this reference. For example, if the width of the averaging window is set to 7 counts, then averaging is performed by summing the value of the current count, three counts to the left of it, three to the right, and dividing the resulting sum by 7.

If the time gap between adjacent counts exceeds 5 minutes, then averaging is not performed. It is also not performed for samples that are at the very beginning and at the very end of the buffer, because there is not enough data to average.

The "Graph line thickness" option in this case selects the thickness of the graph lines of the average values relative to the thickness of the outline lines of the main (gray) graphs.

Y-Axis Scale: selection between linear, logarithmic and square root scales.

Y-axis zoom mode:

· Across the entire range: minimum and maximum values of the Y-axis data is calculated over the entire range of data.

· By visible area: minimum and maximum values of the Y-axis data is calculated from the plot of data shown on the graph.

Stroke graphs: If you disable this option, the application will not outline the graphs with a bright line.

* ·  Average dose rate of X-ray and gamma radiation over the time of spectrum accumulation.
* ·  X-ray and gamma radiation dose over the accumulation time of the spectrum.
*   ·  The way the graph is updated, or, for the "View Spectrum" window, the name of the spectrum.

    In the mode of displaying the graph of difference between spectrum and background the values of count rate and dose rate will be equal to the difference of these values for spectrum and background. The accumulated dose will be calculated by the formula (Ds - Db) \* Ts, where Ds is the spectrum dose, Db is the background dose, Ts is the spectrum accumulation time. In difference mode, spectrum information is displayed in italics as a reminder.

    The display of each item except the last is controlled by the corresponding setting. Unnecessary data can be turned off to save screen space.

    The part of the graph in which the shape of the spectrum should be considered unreliable due to the small volume of events accumulated there is drawn in gray.

    Depending on the settings, the X-axis can display either channel numbers or photon energy. The Y- axis can display either the number of pulses or the count rate. The Y-axis scale can be linear or logarithmic.

Tapping the graph at a display scale of x1, displays the cursor lines. The vertical line corresponding to the position on the X-axis can be moved by tapping the screen at the desired point or moving your finger across the screen. The horizontal line is automatically positioned to the position of the pointer on the X-axis.

To display marker lines at a scale greater than x1, do long tap on the screen, then marker lines will appear. Move the vertical line left and right without lifting your finger from the screen.

If marker lines are present, then a "magnifying glass" ("zoom") is displayed in the lower corner of the spectrum graph by default - a small window in which a section of the graph corresponding to the vertical marker line is visible at an enlarged scale. The magnifier allows you to position the marker lines on the peaks more precisely. In the spectrum settings, you can set the position of the magnifier on the chart or turn it off.

Quick double tap toggles the display mode between linear and logarithmic.\
At the bottom of the spectrum window there is a slider that controls “enhancement” of a histogram.

A curve of the following type is superimposed on the graph:

This allows subtle peaks to appear on the graph. For each channel, the value is calculated by the formula Vn = Vn An F + 1, where:

n - channel number\
Vn - spectrum value (number of pulses or count rate) in channel n An - the value at the corresponding point of the amplifying curve F - gain factor, which is set by the slider, from 0 to 5.

In amplification mode with F >= 1, the digitization of the Y axis is not displayed.

Filter Engine applies a smoothing algorithm to the spectrum graph. The higher the filter value, the more the graph is smoothed.

Calibrating the energy scale of the device

1.  6.1  Background Usage

    In the application RadiaCode it is possible to display on the graph not only the spectrum of accumulated emission, but also to compare the spectrum with the previously measured background spectrum. One can display spectrum and background graphs at the same time in the overlay mode, or display a graph of the difference between the values ?of the current spectrum and the background.

    To use a background, you first need to measure this background with the device over a period of time. Then you need to save the resulting spectrum to the spectrum library. To do this, tap the local

    menu call button in the spectrum window:

    Select “Save Spectrum to Library” from the dropdown menu. You will be prompted to name the spectrum. The spectrum will be displayed with this name in the library list. If you leave the “Set as Current Background” option enabled, then after saving the spectrum will be displayed on the graph as a background. You can also select the background from the spectra library in future.

    There are two modes for displaying spectrum and background. In the overlay mode, the background graph is drawn on top of the spectrum graph - the spectrum is drawn in orange, the background in green. In the second mode, the difference between the spectrum and the background is displayed, the color of the graph is purple.

    In the mode of displaying the difference between the spectrum and the background, the difference in the count rate is displayed, since the background and the current spectrum always have different accumulation times and it makes no sense to subtract the number of accumulated pulses.

    If using spectrum and background from different devices for superposition RadiaCode-10X, it should be borne in mind that different devices have different calibration factors. When overlaying spectra graphs, the application compares them per channel (the first channel with the first channel, the second channel with the second channel, etc.). Different devices have different emission energies corresponding to the same spectral channels, therefore, when the graphs from different devices are superimposed, differences in the positions of the peaks corresponding to the same emission energy will appear.

    If the application detects such a situation, it issues an appropriate warning. Device RadiaCode-10X is identified by its serial number.
2.  6.2  Displaying isotope information\
    When you tap the graph and move your finger across the screen, the application header displays

    information about the radioactive isotope, the energy of which corresponds to the cursor position:

    The name of the isotope, the corresponding energy is displayed, in square brackets - the energy corresponding to the cursor line on the spectrum graph. The name of the decay chain for the isotope is displayed below.

To see examples of spectra of common isotopes, tap here.

In case the option "Display gamma line position" is enabled:

The pink line marks the position of the isotope energy line. If the isotope has accompanying lines, then they are displayed in turquoise (see the figure in the “Spectrum” topic). The dotted lines correspond to the X-ray lines.

If there are several isotopes with close energies, then information about that isotope is displayed, the energy line of which is closest to the value of the energy corresponding to the cursor.

If the "Display gamma lines intensity" or "Draw markers on intensity lines" option is enabled, red lines/markers corresponding to the intensity of gamma radiation lines, relative to the activity of the parent nuclide, are drawn over or instead of turquoise isotope lines.

6.3 Spectrum settings\
The spectrum settings are called by the button on the "Spectrum" and "View" tabs. The

spectrum settings are the same for both pages, but they are independent of each other.

* ·  Scale of the Y-axis - linear or logarithmic. Fast scale switching - with icons “Lin.” and “Log.”.
* ·  Units of the Y-axis - the number of pulses or the count rate.
* ·  X-axis units - channel number or photon energy.
* ·  Graph update: either automatically at a preset interval or manually with the button .
* ·  Show last channel: Turn on/off the display of the last channel data. The counter of the last channel includes not only the data of this channel itself, but also all data outside the range displayed on the graph, so it may not always be interesting to look at the last channel.
* ·  Drawing the graph: You can choose to fill the spectrum graph with color (fill) and stroke with a line, or one of these options.
* ·  Drawing the background: You can set the background to fill the graph with a color (fill) and stroke with a line, or one of these options.
* ·  Displaying the background: cm. Using the background.
*   ·  Display isotope information: In the application window title bar, display information about the characteristic gamma line of the isotope and decay chain, and display an icon to go to a website for more information. Disabling this option also disables the display of all isotope lines.

    qDisplay the position of the gamma lines: Draw turquoise clue lines corresponding to the position of isotope energies.

    qDisplay the intensity of the gamma lines: Draw red clue lines corresponding to the positions and intensities of isotope energies.

    qDraw markers on the lines of intensity: Display the gamma line intensity amplitude as red dots on the isotope lines.
* ·  "Spectrum Information" group: You can select which spectrum information to display in the upper right corner of the graph:

q Accumulation time is the total recording time of the spectrum.\
q The number of pulses is the total number of pulses in the spectrum, for the entire time of its

recording.

q The count rate is the average value of the count rate of the spectrum over all channels during the accumulation time, i.e. the sum of the number of pulses of all channels divided by the accumulation time.

q Dose rate is the average value of the dose rate of the spectrum over the accumulation time. The dose rate is calculated using a special algorithm.

q Dose is the radiation dose accumulated during the accumulation of the spectrum.\
q Hardness is the hardness coefficient of the spectrum calculated from the dose rate and count

rate.

* ·  Display "zoom": Select the magnifier display mode. Zoom is a small window in which a section of the graph corresponding to the vertical marker line is visible at an enlarged scale. In the "Automatic" mode, the application itself selects the zoom position according to the vertical marker line position.
* ·  Show the amplification slider: Below the spectrum graph you can see the slider that adjusts the "amplification" of the histogram, see below.
* ·  Show the filter slider: Below the spectrum graph you can see the slider that adjusts the degree of filtering (smoothing) of the histogram, see below.
* ·  Gaps between bars in the “Fill only” mode: Draw bars with gaps between them, rather than a solid graph contour line, if the selected scale allows it and the "Draw a polyline instead of a histogram" option is disabled.
* ·  Draw a polyline instead of a histogram: instead of rectangular bars (histogram), draw a polyline that connects the midpoints of the tops of the bars. The graph is not entirely “true”, because the accumulation of the spectrum is still discrete for each channel. In this mode, the option “Gaps between bars in the “Fill only” mode” has no meaning and is ignored.
* ·  Do not display negative values i?n the spectrum-background difference mode: Display only the top of the spectrum versus background difference plot that corresponds to positive difference values. Negative values ?will be displayed as zero.
* ·  Automatically scale the Y-axis: When the scale is more than 1, automatically select the scale of the Y axis in accordance with the maximum value of the data in the displayed area of t?he graph.
* ·  Export format: Choose in which format export the spectrum.
*   ·  csv Export separator: you can specify which symbol to use when exporting the spectrum to a

    text file with the .csv extension (comma or semicolon).
*   ·  Calibration coefficients: a page opens where you can specify the calibration factors a0, a1 and

    a2.

    Spectrum calibration is performed to convert the number of the spectrum channel to the value of the emission energy in keV using a polynomial of the 2nd degree of the form:

    E=a0 +a1·x+a2·x2,

    where\
    x is the channel number;\
    a0, a1, a2 are calibration coefficients.

6.4 View tab\
The “View” tab is intended for static viewing of spectra from spectra libraries. The functionality of the

tab and control is the same as on the main “Spectrum” tab, except that the update button is

replaced with a button for switching to the spectrum library, and the name of the spectrum is displayed instead of information about the update.

To load a spectrum for viewing, you need to open the spectra library, tap the desired spectrum and select “Load to view” in the dropdown menu.

The preview displays the same background as in the main Spectrum tab.

5.  6.5  Export and import of spectra\
    Spectra are exported with the command “Share”, which is called through the dropdown menus

    in the “Spectrum” and “View” tabs, as well as the window of the spectra library.

    Two formats are supported: .xml (default) and .csv. Both formats are supported by the popular Becquerel Monitor software. You can select the export format in the spectrum settings.

    A file in xml format can simultaneously include a spectrum and a background and contains all information about them - names, number of channels, spectrum accumulation time, calibration factors and the serial number of the device on which the spectrum and background were taken. This format is self-sufficient and does not require additional steps from the user when importing; xml files can be imported directly from instant messengers like WhatsApp and Telegram.

    A csv file is a text file with a .csv extension that can be used not only with the Becquerel monitor, but also with other applications due to the simplicity of its format. Only pairs of values ”?channel number, number of pulses” are written to the file. In the spectrum settings, you can choose which separator to use - comma or semicolon. The file name is formed as “Spectrum\_\<Current date/time>\_s.csv”, for example, Spectrum\_2021-05-12\_13-53- 55\_1426s.csv. When importing csv file into application RadiaCode a window is displayed where it is proposed to enter the spectrum name, the accumulation time (if it was not possible to determine it from the file name), as well as the serial number of the device, on which the spectrum was taken, and the calibration factors. It is possible to indicate to the application that the imported spectrum was taken with the currently connected device - for this there is a special button “Copy factors and serial number from the device”.

    For spectrum and background overlapping from different devices RadiaCode-10X read here. It is also possible to export several spectra simultaneously as a zip archive.\
    Importing a spectrum to the library

    Application RadiaCode is registered in the smartphone as a handler for files with the .xml and .csv extensions. When tapping a file with the .xml or .csv extension in any other Android application, for example, in WhatsApp or Telegram, the application RadiaCode will be in the “Open with...” list. If you open the file with RadiaCode, the spectrum will be imported into the spectrum library, you will be prompted to set the import parameters for the spectrum.

    You can also import a spectrum using the button . The system file picker opens.

    Calibrating the energy scale of the spectrum is necessary to accurately determine the energy of the

the factory, but detector parameters may change over time, necessitating a calibration update. It would require sources with known isotopic composition and energies in advance. The calibration points are the vertices of the peaks on the gamma spectrum. The result of the calibration is the values of the calibration factors, which are used by the device to convert the spectrum channel number into the radiation energy value in keV using a polynomial of degree 2 kind:

E=a0 +a1·x+a2·x2,

where\
x is the channel number;\
a0, a1, a2 are calibration coefficients.

Spectrum energy scale calibration procedure

The calibration is performed at three points, which ensures sufficient linearity over the entire range of energies under study. To perform the calibration, the user will need a spectrum containing mono- energy lines, preferably located at the beginning, middle and end of the energy scale. For example, the following isotopes produce such lines:

· K-40 (1461 keV);\
· Am-241 (59 keV);\
· Lu-176 (202, 307 keV);\
· Cs-137 (32, 662 keV);\
· Th-232 (238, 583, 2614 keV); · Ra-226 (78, 351, 609 keV);

The most convenient and simple for calibration is Th-232, a naturally occurring element. In most countries around the world, small quantities of Th-232 are legal and available for purchase in local stores, for example, in the form of welding electrodes WT-20.

More details are explained in this instructional calibration video.

You can also use alternative sources or their combinations for calibration. For example Cs-137 and K-40. It is not necessary to collect the spectrum with both sources at once, you can collect two separate spectra and memorize the channels where the lines are located during calibration. For example, after collecting the spectrum of Cs-137, remember that on channel 3 there was a peak with an energy of 32 keV, and on channel 66 there was a peak with an energy of 662 keV. And after collecting the K-40 spectrum, by selecting these channels, enter the appropriate energy (32, 662, 1461 keV).

For three-point calibration with a single source, it is best to use Th-232-based sources, but a certain peculiarity must be taken into account: the first line is better chosen at the low-energy level, the X- ray fluorescence line. If the source is a thoriated electrode, the X-ray fluorescence energy will be about 65 keV, but if the source does not contain heavy elements, the line will have an energy of about 88 keV.

After calibrating the device, it is desirable to test it on sources with a different isotopic composition. Also, because of the nonlinearity introduced by the discreteness of the channel step, the lines may not always fall exactly into the channel where they are supposed to be. This is especially true at the beginning of the spectrum.

Spectrum 32

If a rough calibration without a source is necessary, the K-40 isotope is recommended. It is necessary to dial the background spectrum, where the peak at 1461 keV or potassium fertilizer will be clearly visible, and the peak should be completely colored in yellow. Then, entering the settings, change the calibration factor A1 in increments of 0.1 until the top of the peak is at 1461 keV.

Calibration procedure

1. Place the device and the reference source to be measured as close as possible to each other. The detector should be placed with a "+" sign on the source or, if the source is powerful, pointed in its direction with a "+" sign. It is desirable that the count rate should not exceed 500 cps during calibration.
2. In the "Spectrum" tab, reset the spectrum by clicking on and select "Restart Accumulation" from the drop-down menu.
3. Having determined the choice of reference points, wait until all spectral lines (Gaussians), on which the calibration will be carried out, are colored yellow, which will indicate sufficient statistical reliability of the spectrum data.
4. Tap on and select "Energy Scale Calibration" from the drop-down menu. At the top of the tab, you will be prompted to enter the energy value:
5. Touch the graph and, by moving the marker lines, select the first point on the graph. Enter the energy corresponding to the point next to the "Next" button. Tap the "Next" button.
6. Repeat this manipulation twice and select the "Done" button.
7. The application will check the channel number values for validity. If the values are invalid, a diagnostic message about it will be displayed. If the values are acceptable, a window will be displayed with a table with energy values and corresponding spectrum channel numbers, and under the table the calculated values of the calibration factors:

Spectrum

Invalid values of calibration factors are displayed in red. The application blocks the ability to write such values to the device.

You can manually correct the table data, and changing energies and/or channel numbers will cause automatic recalculation of the factor values.

8. Tap the "Program factors to device" button to complete the calibration. If the calibration was initiated from the View tab, the button will save the spectrum open for viewing to the library with new coefficients.

If you need to return the factory calibration of the device or correct the calibration factors manually, you can use the "Calibration factors" button in the “Device settings” dialog boxdialog box.

6.7 1024 spectrum channels instead of 256\
Device firmware version 4+ supports 1024-channel spectra. Earlier firmware versions supported

256-channel spectra.

The number of spectrum channels is determined by the digit capacity of the ADC used, which digitizes the signal of the device's scintillation detector. The higher bit rate, i.e. 10 bits instead of 8 bits, allows 1024 channels of spectrum. This provides a clearer separation of the spectrum peaks in the low energy region of radiation. The transition to 10-bit spectra became possible due to application of special algorithms and techniques of signal processing at the ADC output. These

algorithms minimized the effect of the nonlinearity of the ADC characteristic on the shape of the spectrum.

Application RadiaCode works with 10-bit spectra. When loading from the spectra library and importing old 8-bit spectra (256 channels) from files, they are converted to 10-bit spectra (1024 channels). It should be kept in mind that:

*   ·  When converting spectra from 8-bit to 10-bit, the values of calibration coefficients are recalculated: the value of a0 does not change, a1 decreases by a factor of 4, a2 decreases by a

    factor of 16.
*   ·  In the spectra and spectrogram library, 8-bit spectra are labeled with an orange circle with the

    number 8 in the lower right corner. Calibration coefficients are displayed as converted for a 10-bit

    spectrum.
*   ·  The 1024-channel spectra and spectrograms are always stored in the spectra and spectrogram

    library and exported.
*   ·  Drawing and processing of large spectrograms may be slower due to the increased number of

    channels.
*   ·  The application will work normally with a device that has firmware version less than 4.00 that

    produces 256-channel spectra. However, it is recommended to update the firmware to the latest

    version.
*   ·  Earlier versions of the application designed to work with 256-channel spectra will not work

    correctly with a device that has firmware version 4+.

* ·  in gpx format (a free text format for storing and exchanging GPS data). gpx files can be opened in a browser with a variety of viewing tools. When exporting the gpx file, the application specifies the dose rate value in micro-roentgen as the altitude above sea level.
*   ·  in kmz format (compressed .kml) for viewing in Google Earth (https://earth.google.com/) and in other programs that support the .kml/.kmz format.

    When exporting a track in the .kmz format, one can set the following settings:

    * Marker size: By default, Google Earth draws markers of some automatically selected size. This setting allows controlling the marker size in Google Earth.
    * Marker transparency: One can choose the degree of transparency of the markers: 0% - opaque, 75% - almost transparent.
    * Decimation of markers: Do not add a marker to the file if the distance in meters between it and the previous marker is less than the specified one, and the difference in dose rate values i?s not too large. This allows reducing the number of markers on the map. For decimation, the same algorithms are used as when drawing a track in the application.
    * HTML in point descriptions: Each point is assigned a text string that is displayed in Google Earth when the marker is clicked - date/time, dose rate, location accuracy. Google Earth allows using an HTML markup in descriptions, which makes the text more readable. However, not all programs that work with the .kmz format understand HTML correctly, and for such programs, you can turn off HTML in the text.

    Settings specific to Google Maps:\
    In field “Map type” you can choose how the map will look - a diagram, a satellite photo or a hybrid

    version.

    Theme for Diagramthe "Scheme" mode: you can select a map theme: light (the default), dark or let the app select the theme according to the smartphone's light sensor. In the latter case, the theme switches automatically if the light level has changed and remains stable for 10 seconds. Due to the use of the ambient light sensor, the power consumption of the application may increase slightly.

    Do not add markers to the map outside of the displayed area: This option can optimize the map performance when there are a lot of points in the track. If the number of points is more than 500, then when moving and scaling the map, all markers are deleted and only those that are within the map area visible on the screen are re-added. This causes track markers to blink, but the map is

drawn faster due to the limited number of markers added. The effectiveness of this technology depends on the ratio of visible markers and their total number in the track (if the entire track is displayed on the map, then the efficiency will even be negative), as well as the speed of the smartphone.

Settings specific to OpenStreetMap:

OpenStreetMap map source: by default (online), the variant when the map is loaded as ready raster images-tiles from the servers of companies-partners of OpenStreetMap is applied. The second option is to work with maps in offline mode, i.e., no Internet connection is required for this. The source of maps are vector map files, which you need to download yourself from one of the sites listed on the page https://download.mapsforge.org/ (it's more convenient to do it with a computer) and put it in the RadiaCode app folder on your smartphone

named /sdcard/Android/data/com.almacode.radiacode/files/Maps.\
When downloading maps, it is better to choose the format of version 5, maps of this format are in

the folder with the name v5:

At the moment Mapsforge library does not support work with files given the restrictions on access to files that impose the rules of Android system versions 11+, so the map files must be placed in the folder whose name is given above.

In offline mode, map rendering, i.e. the conversion of vector information into a picture, is performed by the Mapsforge library, which is built into the application. This operation requires some smartphone processor resources. When you move the map around the screen and zoom in, the app will consume more power than in online mode.

Map theme: In offline mode, you can choose between two display options, which differ mainly in color palette.

Image scaling: In online mode, the application obtains images of areas of the map with a low resolution. On high-resolution smartphone screens, the inscriptions on such a map look too small, so the images have to be scaled. After scaling, the final image may look a little blurry, but you have to choose between image quality and inscription size. You can find the optimal ratio by using manual scaling. Offline mode does not have this problem, but you can still experiment with the scale.

Marker rendering optimization: In offline mode, you can select the way that the OpenStreetMap library will use to optimize marker rendering. If large tracks take too long to render, you can try changing this setting.

10.2 Pseudo tracks

A pseudo track is a track generated by the application based on the dose rate data that was written to the database when the option is enabled “Save geographic coordinates of measurements in the database”.

To build a pseudo-track, select the desired point on the graph or the desired entry in the log and make a long tap on the screen. A dropdown menu will open. Select the “Show on the map” item in it (it will be available only if the above option was enabled during the measurement and the application received location data from the system). You will be prompted to select time limits for creating a pseudo track:

The map will open, it will display the markers that fall within the selected time interval. It should be taken into account that not operational, but already processed data are entered into the database, which come from the device with a frequency that depends on the current radiation situation. For small changes in dose rate values, data is received at a frequency of approximately 2 minutes, with sharp changes, data is received more frequently. When creating a pseudo track, all map settings are taken into account and the same decimation and filtering algorithms are applied as when building a regular track.

The pseudo track displayed on the map can be saved in the tracks library using the button on the toolbar:

The RadiaCode application provides photo-related features:

* ·  Taking photos with superimposed images of graphs, search, spectrum, spectrogram, activity diagram, track, and log.
* ·  Associating photos, including those taken outside the application, with spectra, spectrograms, tracks, and log entries (attaching photos).
* ·  Viewing attached photos, replacing, and deleting them.
*   ·  Exporting and importing spectra, spectrograms, and tracks as zip archives along with photos,

    including multiple objects at once.

    For photo-related operations, the application requests permission to access media files. Permission is also requested to take photos.

    Taking photos

    To enter the shooting mode, select "Camera" in the main menu, which is called by the icon. A screen will open with an image received from the smartphone camera (preview) with a graph, spectrum, track, etc. superimposed on it. The exact image (overlay) type that will be superimposed on the image from the camera is determined by which page in the application was active at the time the camera was called.

    Entering the camera mode is blocked if taking a photo does not make sense, i.e. there is no object to which the taken photo can be linked. For example, if the "Spectrum" tab is active, but the device is not connected and there is no spectrum data, or, for example, the track is not recorded in the map mode.

After shooting, the resulting image is displayed on the screen with a suggestion to save it and optionally attach it to the object (in this case, the spectrum). For tracks, the image is attached to the last point of the track, for graphs - to the last entry in the database.

The display settings in the overlay window are the same as those of the page from which the camera mode was opened. Due to the scaling of the overlay window, the image in it may differ from the original, especially for spectrograms.

Access to attached images

On the charts, attached images are displayed with a camera symbol:

Long-touching a point on the chart corresponding to a picture opens a drop-down menu containing the item "Picture". The submenu "Picture" contains the items:

In the spectra, spectrograms and tracks libraries, the presence of an attached image is indicated by a camera symbol:

The drop-down menu that opens when you tap a row in the library also has an item called "Picture", which contains the same menu for managing an attached picture. If the picture is not attached, then only the "Attach" item will be available.

For tracks, it is possible to attach images not only to the entire track, but also to individual points. Touching the camera symbol on a track point also displays a menu for managing its image.

Additional information

Due to the peculiarities of the Android operating system, including increasing security requirements from version to version, applications cannot always access image files, especially if these files are located in non-standard folders. In some cases, depending on the version and manufacturer of the smartphone, the system denies access to certain files. Sometimes the system does not offer to use

the RadiaCode application to directly open an object file (spectrum, track...) from a messenger - in this case, you should first save the file to a folder, and then open it.

The application stores photos taken with the camera in the RadiaCodeImages subfolder of the standard DCIM media folder. This allows system viewers (Gallery) to see these photos. The exception is when the photos were taken in an Android system version lower than 10 and a removable storage device is selected for storage - then the photos are stored in the DCIM/RadiaCodeImages subfolder in the application folder itself and are deleted along with the application when uninstalling it.

11.1 Camera settings\
Camera settings are called up by pressing the button from the camera mode.

Where to save media files: If your smartphone has external memory (memory card), you can choose where to save media files.

Camera: You can choose between the rear and front camera of your smartphone. The button in camera mode also allows you to switch cameras.

Flash: Selects the flash mode - auto/on/off. The button in camera mode also allows you to select the flash mode.

Aspect Ratio: Select the aspect ratio of the photo. Most photosensitive sensors installed in smartphones have an aspect ratio of 4:3, and choosing a ratio of 16:9 simply crops the image at the edges.

Image resolution: You can select the photo resolution. By default, if you let the system choose, it will set the maximum possible resolution and the photos will take up quite a lot of space. It is recommended to select a photo resolution close to the smartphone screen resolution to minimize scaling artifacts. The list of resolutions when choosing a custom resolution is provided by the system; the application uses it as is, so there may be some discrepancies between the preview image and the photo, which are related to the different aspect ratios of the photo and preview, as well as the resolution selected in the list. The fourth factor is the screen orientation, which can also affect the appearance of the final photo.

Image quality: The compression quality of the jpeg format in which the photos are saved.

Image watermarks: Watermarks that are superimposed at the bottom of the photo. The Google Geocoder service is used to determine the address. The information provided by this service may be inaccurate, unreliable, or absent altogether. The slider in the group adjusts the transparency of the captions.

Options - Shutter Sound: Play a system sound that simulates the shutter of a mechanical camera when shooting.

Options - Preview resolution same as photo: Try to set the preview window to the same resolution as the photo - see Image resolution above. In this case, the preview image will look approximately the same as the photo.

Options - Map auto-centering when recording a track: By default, when shooting from the map mode, the overlay displays the section of the map that was active when the camera was called up, and the map in the overlay window remains motionless. If you enable this option, the map in the overlay window will automatically move every 10 seconds in accordance with the current coordinates of the smartphone.

17 Export and import

The RadiaCode application implements the export and import of spectra, spectrograms and tracks. Export in the Android system is traditionally designated by the word "Share", it is indicated in all the corresponding menu items. We will call the spectrum, spectrogram and track the word "object".

Export and import of objects of different types is performed according to the same scheme, only the file formats differ. The interface for exporting and importing objects of different types is also the same.

You can export and import several objects at a time, while a zip archive file is created, where the exported objects are stored in compressed form. If desired, you can add pictures attached to the objects to the archive.

Exporting objects

On the control bar (toolbar) of the "Spectrum" and "Spectrogram" tabs, as well as the map toolbar, there is an item that opens a drop-down menu, which contains the "Share..." item. This allows you to export an object without explicitly saving it to the library.

In the spectra, spectrograms, and tracks libraries, tapping a row opens a drop-down menu that also has a "Share..." option. If you mark several objects in the library, you can export them by selecting "Share..." from the drop-down menu that is called by tapping the three-dot icon in the upper right corner of the screen.

If folders are selected in the library, all objects from the selected folders, including nested ones, are also exported. It is also possible to export all objects contained in a folder without marking it - the "Export folder" command is available in the menu that appears when you long-tap a folder.

The format of exported files is set in the spectrum, spectrogram and track settings. When exporting, files with the extensions specified in the table are created:

|                            |                       |                                  |
| -------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Object type                | Uncompr essed objects | Compressed objects (zip archive) |
| Spectrum .xml, .csv .zrcsp |                       |                                  |
| Spectrogr am               | .rcspg                | .zrcspg                          |
| Track                      | .rctrk, .gpx, .kmz    | .zrctrk                          |

Before exporting, the application prompts you to choose whether to create a zip archive or export the object to a text file. When exporting multiple objects, a zip archive is always created. If desired, you can include images attached to the objects in the archive. If multiple objects refer to an image with the same name, only one copy of it is placed in the archive.

After creating the exported file, the application prompts you to choose what to do with it. The system tool for selecting the target application opens - the file can be saved, sent via messenger, etc.

Importing objects

There are two ways to import objects into libraries:

Export and import

* ·  Open the appropriate library and tap the three-dot icon in the upper right corner of the screen. Select "Import..." from the drop-down menu. The system file selector will open. The list will contain files with all extensions specified in the table above. It is up to the user to select a file that matches the type of object in the library.
*   ·  Select the RadiaCode application for the "Open with..." operation in another application, such as a messenger or Explorer. The application itself understands by the file extension what type of object(s) is being imported.

    Before import, a request is issued indicating the number of imported objects and images, as well as the total size of the images. You can reject images import.

    If the name of the imported object matches one already in the library, a new name is generated for it by adding a digital postfix in brackets - (1), (2), etc.

    If a single object is imported, after import you are prompted to open it: for a spectrum and spectrogram - load in view, for a track - open on the map.

    Imported images are placed in the DCIM/RadiaCodeImages folder regardless of which folder they were in when exported. If the DCIM/RadiaCodeImages folder already contains images with matching names, they are not overwritten.
